This is a placeholder documentation file.

Replace this content with your real product documentation. The RAG app will:
- Chunk this file into numbered chunks (chunk-00, chunk-01, ...)
- Embed and index the chunks into a local Chroma database under ./data/index
- Retrieve the most relevant chunks for each question
- Answer using ONLY retrieved chunks and cite them like [doc.txt#chunk-00]

Example topics you might include:
- How to reset a password
- How billing works
- Supported platforms and system requirements
- Troubleshooting steps
